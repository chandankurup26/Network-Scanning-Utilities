# Topology-Scanning-Utilities
This project provides a Python-based implementation (`scanner.py`) for discovering network topology in environments that include routers or managed network devices. The script performs automated host discovery and builds a network topology graph by identifying reachable devices and their logical relationships within the network. It is intended for use in controlled lab or enterprise environments where routing devices are present and accessible, enabling a structured representation of network connectivity for analysis, visualization, or academic study.

**Note:** This code is currently under development and is recommended to be executed only on Linux-based environments. Compatibility with other operating systems has not yet been tested or validated.
